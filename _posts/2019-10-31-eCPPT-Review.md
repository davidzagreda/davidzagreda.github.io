## Overall

The eCPPT course was my first very in-depth penetration testing course after completing my eJPT, both from eLearnSecurity. At its fundamentals, it covers in-depth Windows and Linux exploitation, networking fundamentals, system security (buffer overflows), web exploitation, and if you buy the Elite version, you also get access to the Wireless and Ruby modules which are invaluable. I just recently sat for the exam and passed on my free retake (more on this later) and I could not have been happier with the information that this course has taught me.
