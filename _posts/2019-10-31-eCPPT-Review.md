title: eCPPT (PTP) Review
---

## Overall

The PTP course was my first very in-depth penetration testing course after completing my eJPT (PTS), both from eLearnSecurity. At its fundamentals, it covers in-depth Windows and Linux exploitation, networking fundamentals, system security (buffer overflows), web exploitation, and if you buy the Elite version, you also get access to the Wireless and Ruby modules which are invaluable. I just recently sat for the exam and passed on my free retake (more on this later) and I could not have been happier with the information that this course has taught me. 

I will note ahead of time that though the eCPPT and eLearnSecurity as a whole may not have the industry recognition that they deserve (yet), I would still highly recommend this course for anybody interested in the realm of penetration testing. One of my favorite things about this course has been the practical nature of it from the Hera Labs which are fantastic and the fully practical exam. If you plan to take the OSCP, I highly recommend at least taking the eCPPT (or eJPT if you feel you aren't ready for it) beforehand to get yourself accustomed to some of the techniques and tools that penetration testers use and to establish a baseline methodology that you can use on any machine you encounter.

NOTE: PTP is the actual course and the eCPPT is the name of the certification you obtain after completing the course and passing the exam. For simplicity, I will refer to both as the eCPPT for the rest of this article.

## Pricing

The eCPPT pricing comes in three tiers: Barebone, Full, and Elite. I purchased the Elite tier which gave me access to all of the lectures as PDFs instead of HTML with the other plans, 120 hours of lab time with Hera Labs, an infinity voucher (regular voucher expires six months after you begin the course), and access to the Wireless and Ruby sections of the course. The Barebone tier comes in at $1199, Full tier comes in at $1299, and the Elite tier comes in at $1599. I was lucky enough to get this purchase reimbursed through my employer so I highly recommend you pursue this avenue if possible.

NOTE: eLearnSecurity does have sales occasionally during times like Black Friday (coming up soon) and other random months throughout the year, I would subscribe to their mailing list to stay up to date for any discounts to this course.
